Popquiz is a an education and inequality based app

Purpose: 
The goal of this app is to engage learing of information
to those who either have a passing intrest in a field
or not a lot of time to dedicate to the field

Problem:
People who want to learn new information about a skill
set or an area of information are often faced with two major issues

1) The time to learn a skill can often be extremely limiting. 
   Even just gathering educational resources can be a time consuming proccess.
   
2) There is always going to be a lack of avialbe information or at least up-to-date
   information. Wether it be about poverty, science or technology, information is 
   always changing and shifting from day to day and process to process
   
   
Method/Solution:
Our solution to these problems is based off of subtly learning.  Instead of having a
person dedicate 1 hour or 2 hours a day  to learn a skill we want to engage users only
seconds-minutes at a time.  Slowly working through lower based skills and imbedding 
knowledge through repetivite actions.

Some Q&A:
How do we engage users?
We will engage useres during their personal time through regualr intervels by 
determined by algorithms and user input so that we do not disrupt daily treands
and task but still are making progress towards learning goals.

What informatino do we get accross?
We offer a unique mixture of Stem Skills and solcial topics that are kept 
up-to-date by what we will determine to be "Expert users"

How do we decide when a user is ready to move up in level?
We will have a frequence set based off of pervious users, "expert users",
and how many times a person has answered a question correctly.
If need be we can even fuse levels to allow a person to keep working on 
lower set skills while still provding new information
